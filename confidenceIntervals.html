						<h2>Inferential statistics (Confidence Intervals)</h2>
						<p>Often in statistics we want to answer a simple yes or no question, or make guesses about how large or small something might be. The the two key tools we will use
						to answer these kinds of questions are <b>hypothesis testing</b> and <b>confidence intervals</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li> <b>Hypothesis Testing:</b> making a yes or no decision on a population parameter based on a given sample from that population</li>
							<li> <b>Confidence Interval:</b> estimating a range or value of a populations' parameter(s) based on a statistic(s) from a sample</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Notice how both require you to use a information from a sample to calculate the answer. In this unit we will look at confidence intervals and hypothesis test for means and proportions.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Confidence Intervals</h1>
											<p>A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a data sample, that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies within the interval. For example, a 95% confidence interval suggests that we can be 95% confident that the population parameter lies within the interval.</p>
											<p>Uses of Confidence Intervals:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Estimating Population Parameters:</b> Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for population parameters such as the mean or proportion.</li>
												<li><b>Assessing Reliability:</b> Confidence intervals give an idea of the reliability and precision of sample estimates. Narrow intervals suggest more precise estimates, while wider intervals suggest less precision.</li>
												<li><b>Comparing Groups:</b> Confidence intervals can be used to compare differences between groups. If the confidence intervals for two groups do not overlap, this suggests a significant difference between the groups.</li>
												<li><b>Making Informed Decisions:</b> By providing a range of possible values, confidence intervals help in making informed decisions and assessing risks.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Confidence intervals are commonly used in many fields including healthcare, business, and social sciences, where they help in making predictions and guiding policy decisions.</p>

								<h2 id="Sample-proportions">Sample proportions</h2><p>Suppose we take a random sample of 100 North Carolinians and check whether
									they are left handed or right handed. If 13 of them are left handed, we would say that the proportion of them who are left handed is $13\%$.
									That $13\%$ is a <em>sample proportion</em> $\hat{p}$ that estimates the <em>population proportion</em> $p$.</p>
								<p>Note that a proportion is a numerical quantity, even though the data is categorical. Thus, we can compute confidence
									intervals in a very similar way. Just as with sample means, the sampling process leads to a random variable and,
									if certain assumptions are met, then we can expect that random variable to be normally distributed.</p>

												<h2 id="Margin-of-error">Margin of error</h2><p>If you read the details of political surveys, you're likely to come across the term
													"margin of error" at some point. On 2/24/22 the first political story was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/595594-abbott-tops-gop-primary-field-leads-orourke-in-matchup-poll">this
														one from The Hill</a> which discusses political poles in Texas. In that story, we find</p>
														<blockquote><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tops his primary challengers and leads Democrat Beto O’Rourke in the Lone Star State's  2022 gubernatorial race, according to a new poll released Thursday.</p>
															<p>Abbott currently leads O’Rourke in the poll by seven points, with 52 percent to those surveyed supporting Abbott and 45 percent supporting O’Rourke. Three percent are unsure of their vote.</p>

					<h1>How about an example with means:</h1>
					<p>Let's talk about $z^*$. This was calcualted using our <a href="https://onlinestatbook.com/2/calculators/normal_dist.html">standard normal calculator</a> but this is because we could calculate the
					standard deviation from a proportion, we are not always so lucky when it comes to the estimating the mean. In our section on hypothesis testing I will go into more detail about the student t distribution.
					For now let's just focus on how we calculate these valeus.</p>
					<p>If we do know the population standard devation we can use the following formula:</p>
					$$ME = z^* \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
					<p>If we do not know the population's standard devation, then we use the sample standard devaion and a t-interval critical value $t^*$:</p>
					$$ME = t^* \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>How do we get t critical values?</h1>
					<p>While there are a few calculators out there that can find a critical t value for a few percents and degrees of freedom,
					this look up table is still the best resouce I can
					find <a href="https://www.coconino.edu/resources/files/pdfs/academics/sabbatical-reports/kate-kozak/appendix_table.pdf"></a>Link to the table</p>
					<div>
						<img src="https://jorho85.github.io/t_intervalLookup.PNG" alt="t_intervalLookup.PNG" style="height: 425px">
					</div>
					<p>The real table has more values for df. We find the t-critical value we need by looking up the value accoiated with the df and confidence level
						from the problem.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>A example with IQ:</h1>
					<p>A random sample of 20 IQ scores of famous people was taken information from
						the website of IQ of Famous People ("IQ of famous," 2013) and then using a
						random number generator to pick 20 of them. The mean of the sample was $145.4$ and the standard devation
					29.27. Find a 98% confidence interval for the mean of the IQ of famous people. </p>
				<p>We can use our table to find the critical t value for df = 20 - 1 = 19 and confidence level of 98% to get $t^* = 2.539$. Now,</p>
				<div>
					$$ME = 2.539 \times \frac{29.27}{\sqrt{20}} = 16.6$$
				</div>
				<p>and then the confidence interval would be,</p>
				$$145.4 \pm 16.6 = [128.8, 162].$$
