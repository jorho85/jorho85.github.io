        <h1>The Data Table</h1>
        <p>We store data that we collect in a data table. Progames like google sheets and excel are used to create these tables.</p>
        <p>Data tables are essential tools in research for organizing and presenting data in a clear and accessible way.
          They allow researchers and students alike to quickly analyze and draw conclusions from data.
          Here, we present a sample data table that showcases various attributes of a group of college students.
        The table has 5 rows since we got 5 responcese to the survey. Each row is an observation, while each column is a variable.</p>

          <h1>Describing Data</h1>
          <p>We need some key definions to describe data. In order of statistical research to meet the standards of peer review,
          we need to use the same definions and classifications of data. Some of the classifications are a little less strict than what is
        defined in our book. So, first what is a statistic?</p>

          <h2>Understanding Sample, Population, Statistic, and Parameter</h2>
            <p><strong>Population:</strong> A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about in a study.
              For instance, if you are studying the effects of a new teaching method, your population might be all the students at a particular university.</p>
              <p><strong>Sample:</strong> A sample is a subset of the population that is used to represent the population.
                Collecting data from a sample is more feasible than from the entire population. For example, instead of surveying every student at the university,
                you might select 200 students randomly to represent the whole.</p>
              <p><strong>Statistic:</strong> A statistic is a measure that describes a characteristic of a sample.
                It is calculated from the data collected from the sample. An example of a statistic could be the average test score of the students in your sample.</p>
              <p><strong>Parameter:</strong> A parameter is a measure that describes a characteristic of an entire population.
                Since it's often impractical to measure the entire population, the parameter is usually estimated through statistics from the sample.
                For example, using the average test score from your sample, you might estimate the average test score of all students at the university.</p>
        </section>

          <h2>Categorical vs. Numerical Variables</h2>
          <p><strong>Categorical Variables:</strong> Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups.
            These categories are typically qualitative and describe attributes or qualities that do not have inherent numerical values.
            Examples include colors of cars (red, blue, green), types of cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Chinese), or gender (male, female, non-binary).</p>
            <p><strong>Numerical Variables:</strong> Numerical variables represent quantities and can be measured.
              These can be further classified into discrete or continuous variables. Discrete numerical variables represent counts (e.g., the number of students in a class, the number of books on a shelf)
              and take on only integer values. Continuous numerical variables, however, can take on any value within a range and often include measurements
              (e.g., height of students in meters, temperature in degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>Understanding the difference between these types of variables is crucial for data analysis, as it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be performed.
              For example, you might use a bar chart to represent categorical data, while a histogram would be more suitable for numerical data. We will talk more about this in chapter 2.</p>
