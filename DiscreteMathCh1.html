					<h1>Inroduction to Algorithms</h1>
					<p>Algorithms play a very important role in computer science, and thus mathematics plays a
					very important role in computer science. Programs and apps use algorithms to perfore all the task that we
					often take for guarantee. Programers know that decided and outlining an algorithm is the first step in writing
					comptuer programs. Even AI works on algorithms.</p>
					<p>In this chapter we will define what an algorithm, and look at how to design different algorithms to do different task. There will be
					a lot of definitions and examples using python.</p>
				</section>

					<section>
						<h1>What is an algorithm?</h1>
						<p>An <b>algorithm</b> is a finite sequence of <b>well-defined</b> steps to preform some task such that</p>
						<ul>
							<li>each step is a clear instruction that can be done in a finite amount of time</li>
							<li>the sequence in which the steps are done is clear</li>
							<li>the process is guaranteed to stop after a finite number of steps have been done</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When we say well-defined we mean that their can be no ambugity about what must be done on this step. That is we either add 2 or we don't. When we implement
						an algorithm in some programming language we have made a basic comptuer program. When we implemnt an algorithm to solve a real world physical problem we have
						defined a basic math problem. Let's look at an example of implementing an algorithm.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>example - volume of a cube</h1>
						<p>We will use <b>pseudocode</b>, or algorithms writen in plan english, to make algoritms a little easier for those with no code background. Let's
						say we wanted to come up with a process for finding the volume of a cube</p>
						<pre>
							<code>
								Algorithm: Find the volume of a cube with side lenght l.

									1. Input l. (l is the lenght of the cube)
									2. Set volume to $l^3$
									3. Output volume
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>Note that each step is well-defined because we have no ambugity about what to do at any signle step. Let's look at some real code</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Start by typing import numpy as np, then <b>shift + enter</b>, then we want to reproduce the algorithm from before in python.</p>
						<iframe src="https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/repl/index.html?kernel=python&toolbar=1" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Now let's look at the math</h1>
						<p>In mathematics we could use a <b>function</b> to define this algorithm.</p>
						$$f(x) = x^3$$
						<p>In math, functions and variables are often just given letters for names, but notice in the python program we called $f(x)$ volume. Notice that we do
						not have to worry about our program taking to many steps, but some algorithms do have a more sophisticated control structures.</p>
