<h2 id="What-is-probability?">What is <em>probability</em>?</h2><ul>
<li>A <em>random event</em> is an event where we know which possible outcomes <em>can</em> occur
but we don't know which specific outcome <em>will</em> occur.</li>
<li>The set of all the possible outcomes is called the <em>sample space</em>.</li>
<li>If we observe a large number of independent repetitions of a random event, then
the proportion $\hat{p}$ of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to
the <em>probability</em> $p$ of that outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bullet point is called the <em>Law of Large Numbers</em> and is a pillar of
probability theory.</p>

<h3 id="The-Law-of-Large-Numbers">The Law of Large Numbers</h3><p>The Law of Large Numbers can be written symbolically as</p>
$$P(A) \approx \frac{\# \text{ of occurrences of } A}{\# \text{ of trials}}.$$<p>More importantly, the error in the approximation approaches zero as the number of trials approaches $\infty$.</p>
<p>Again, this is a <em>symbolic</em> representation where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbol $A$ represents a set of possible outcome contained in the
sample space. Such a set is often called an <em>event</em>.</li>
<li>The symbol $P$ represents a function that computes probability. </li>
<li>Thus, $P(A)$ tells us the probability that the event $A$ occurs.</li>

<h3 id="The-role-of-Independence">The role of Independence</h3><p>It's important to understand that observations made in the Law of Large numbers
are <em>independent</em> - the separate occurrences have nothing to do with one another
and prior events cannot influence future events.</p>

<li>I flip a fair coin 5 times and it happens to come up heads each time. What is the probability that I get a tail on the next flip?</li>

<h2 id="Computing-probabilities">Computing probabilities</h2><p>We now turn to the question of how to compute the probabily of certain types of events, which is not so bad, once you understand a few formulae and basic principles.</p>
<p>The serious, mathematical study of probability theory has its origins in the $17^{\text{th}}$ century in the writings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> who studied - gambling. Many elmentary examples in probability theory are still commonly phrased in terms of gambling. As a result, it's long standing tradition to use coin flips, dice rolls and playing cards to illustrate the basic principles of probability. Thus, it does help to have a basic familiarity with these things.</p>

<h3 id="Cards">Cards</h3><p>A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards divided into 13 ranks each of which is further divided into 4 suits</p>
<ul>
<li>13 ranks: A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,K,Q</li>
<li>4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jorho85.github.io/cardsImage.PNG" width="80%" /></p>
<p>When we speak of a "well shuffled deck" we mean that, when we draw one card,
each card is equally likely to be drawn. Similarly, when we speak of a fair
coin or a fair die, we mean each outcome produced (heads/tails or 1-6) is equally
likely to occur.</p>
<p>That brings us our first formula for computing probabilities!</p>

<h3 id="Equal-likelihoods">Equal likelihoods</h3><p>When when the sample space is a finite set and all the individual outcomes are
all equally likely, then the probability of an event $A$ can be computed by</p>
$$P(A) = \frac{\# \text{ of possibilities in } A}{\text{total } \#
  \text{ of possibilities}}.$$<h4 id="Examples">Examples</h4><p>Suppose we draw a card from a well shuffled standard deck of 52 playing cards.</p>

<h3 id="Mutually-exclusive-events">Mutually exclusive events</h3><p>The events $A$ and $B$ are called <em>mutually exclusive</em> if only one of them can occur.
Another term for this same concept is <em>disjoint</em>. If we know the probability that $A$ occurs and we know the probability that $B$ occurs, then we can compute the probability that $A$ or $B$ occurs by simply adding the probabilities. Symbolically,</p>
$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B).$$<p>I emphasize, this formula is <em>only valid under the assumption of disjointness</em>.</p>

that both occur. Symbolically:</p>
$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B).$$<h4 id="Examples">Examples</h4><p>Yet again, we draw a card from a well shuffled standard deck of 52

<h5 id="Computation">Computation</h5><p>Now, things are getting a little tougher so let's include the computation for that
second one right here. Let's define our symbols and say</p>
\begin{align*}
  A &amp;= \text{we draw an odd numbered card} \\
  B &amp;= \text{we draw a club}.
\end{align*}<p>In a standard deck, there are four odd numbers we can draw: 3, 5, 7, and 9; and
four of each of those for a total of 16 odd numbered cards. Thus,
$$P(A) = \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}.$$
There are also 13 clubs so that
$$P(B) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}.$$</p>
<p>Now, there are four odd numbered cards that are clubs - the 3 of clubs, the 5 of
clubs, the 7 of clubs, and the 9 of clubs. Thus, the probability of drawing an
odd numbered card that is also a club is
$$P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.$$
Putting this all together, we get
$$P(A \text{ or } B) = \frac{4}{13} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{13} = \frac{25}{52}.$$</p>

<h3 id="Independent-events">Independent events</h3><p>When two events are independent, we can compute the probability that both occur by multiplying their probabilities. Symbolically,

<h3 id="Conditional-probability">Conditional probability<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conditional-probability">&#182;</a></h3><p>When two events $A$ and $B$ are not independent, we can use a generalized form of
the multiplication rule to compute the probability that both occur, namely
$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B|A).$$
That last term, $P(B|A)$, denotes the conditional probability that $B$ occurs <em>under the assumption</em> that $A$ occurs.</p>
<h4 id="Example">Example<a class="anchor-link" href="#Example">&#182;</a></h4><p>We draw two cards from a well-shuffled deck. What is the probability that
both are hearts?</p>

<h4 id="Example-(continued)">Example (continued)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Example-(continued)">&#182;</a></h4><p>We draw two cards from a well-shuffled deck. What is the probability that
both are hearts?</p>
<h5 id="Computation">Computation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Computation">&#182;</a></h5><p>The probability of that the first is a heart is $13/52=1/4$. The probability
that the second card is a heart is different because we now have a deck with 51 cards and
12 hearts. Thus, the probability of getting a second heart is $12/51 = 4/17$. Thus, the
answer to the question is
$$\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{4}{17} = \frac{1}{17}.$$
To write this symbolically, we might let</p>
<ul>
<li>$A$ denote the event that the first draw is a heart and</li>
<li>$B$ denote the event that the second draw is a heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we express the above as
$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B\,|\,A) = \frac{1}{4}\times\frac{4}{17} = \frac{1}{17}.$$</p>

<h3 id="Turning-the-computation-around">Turning the computation around<a class="anchor-link" href="#Turning-the-computation-around">&#182;</a></h3><p>Sometimes, it is the computation of conditional probability itself that we are interested in.
Thus, we might rewrite our general multiplication rule in the form
$$P(B\,|\,A)  = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}.$$</p>

<h2 id="Data">Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In statistics, we'd often like to compute probabilities from data. For example, here's a contingency table based on our CDC data relating smoking and exercise:</p>
