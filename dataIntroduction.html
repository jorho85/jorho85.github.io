					<h1>Chapter 2 Graphing data</h1>
					<p>In chapter 2 we will look at graphing data by constructing a frequency table. We will also look at the idea of a box plot, but we will wait till chapter 3
					to learn how to calculate the 5 number summary necessary to make a box plot.</p>
					<p>In both chapters 2 and 3 our main goal is to talk about the center and spread of our data. With the graphs we want to visualize these ideas for our data set,
					while in chapter 3 we will look at calculating statistics that quantify the idea of center and spread.</p>
				</section>

    				<h2>Introduction to Frequency Tables</h2>
    				<p>Frequency tables are tools used in statistics to organize data into a table format that shows the frequency of various outcomes in a sample.
							Each entry in a frequency table contains the frequency or count of occurrences of values within a particular group or interval.</p>
    				<p>Today, we'll explore how to create and interpret frequency tables for numerical data, focusing on key concepts such as class width, class limits, and boundaries.</p>
 					</section>
					<section>
					    <h2>Numerical Data Frequency Table</h2>
					    <p>The frequency table for numerical data groups data into classes or intervals. Below is an example of such a table, showing the distribution of student ages:</p>
					    <img src="frequencyTable.PNG" alt="Frequency table of student ages">
					</section>
					<section>
					    <h2>Key Concepts in Numerical Frequency Tables</h2>
					    <ul>
					        <li><strong>Class Width</strong>: The difference between the upper and lower boundaries of any class. Formula: \( \text{Class Width} = \text{Lower Bound} - \text{Previous Lower Bound} \)
									in our example we see $19 - 15 = 4$ so it has a class width of 4.</li>
					        <li><strong>Class Limits</strong>: The smallest and largest data value that can belong to a class. Example from our table: 15 is lower limit(bound) and 18 is an upper limit(bound).</li>
					        <li><strong>Class Boundaries</strong>: These are used to eliminate gaps between classes for continuous data.
										They are calculated by taking the average between the upper limit of one class and the lower limit of the next. Example: 18.5 is the boundary between 18 and 19.</li>
					        <li><strong>Class Midpoints</strong>: The point in the middle of the class interval, calculated as \( \text{Midpoint} = \frac{\text{Lower Limit} + \text{Upper Limit}}{2} \).
										Example for the first class: 16.5.</li>
					    </ul>
					</section>
					<section>
							<h2>Example of a Categorical Frequency Table</h2>
							<p>Categorical frequency tables group data based on attribute or category rather than numerical intervals. Here's an example:</p>
							<table border="1" style="color: white;">
									<caption>Favorite Color of Students</caption>
									<thead>
											<tr>
													<th>Color</th>
													<th>Frequency</th>
											</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
											<tr>
													<td>Blue</td>
													<td>10</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Green</td>
													<td>7</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Red</td>
													<td>8</td>
											</tr>
									</tbody>
							</table>
							<p>This type of table is best visualized using a bar plot, where each category is represented as a bar whose height reflects the frequency of responses.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
    				<h2>Calculating Relative Frequency</h2>
    				<p>Relative frequency is a measure of the number of times a particular value or class occurs relative to the total number of occurrences in a dataset.
							It helps in understanding the proportion or percentage of observations within a specific category compared to the entire sample.</p>

    				<h3>Formula for Relative Frequency</h3>
    				<p>The relative frequency of a category is calculated using the formula:</p>
    				<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Relative Frequency = \( \frac{\text{Frequency of the category}}{\text{Total frequency of all categories}} \)</strong></p>
    				<p>Where:</p>
    					<ul>
        				<li><strong>Frequency of the category</strong> is the number of times a particular value or class appears in the dataset.</li>
        				<li><strong>Total frequency of all categories</strong> is the sum of the frequencies of all classes or values in the dataset.</li>
    					</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
    				<h3>Example</h3>
    				<p>Consider a dataset with the following values for a variable representing the colors of cars in a parking lot: Red (15), Blue (25), Green (10), Yellow (5).</p>
    				<p>The total frequency is \( 15 + 25 + 10 + 5 = 55 \).</p>
    				<p>The relative frequency for Red cars is \( \frac{15}{55} \approx 0.273 \) or 27.3%.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
    				<h3>Graphical Representation: Pie Chart</h3>
    				<p>Relative frequencies are best visualized using a pie chart, where each slice represents a category's proportion relative to the whole.
							This type of chart is particularly effective in showing the size of each category at a glance, making it easy to compare proportions.</p>
    				<div style="text-align: center;">
        				<img src="Interpretingpiechart.png" alt="Pie chart showing the distribution of favorite movies">
        				<p>Figure: Pie chart showing the distribution of favorite movies</p>
    				</div>

    				<p>Using pie charts, it's easier to communicate the relative importance of categories, making them ideal for presentations and reports where understanding the proportionate distribution of data is essential.</p>
 					</section>
					<section>
					    <h2>Visualizing Data from Frequency Tables</h2>
					    <p>Visual representations of data help in understanding the distribution and trends:</p>
					    <ul>
					        <li><strong>Histogram</strong>: Used for numerical data. It uses bars to show the frequency of data points within each class interval.</li>
					        <li><strong>Bar Plot</strong>: Used for categorical data. Each category is represented by a bar, and the height of the bar indicates the frequency of occurrences.</li>
					    </ul>
							<p>Let's go look at our data explore for more examples: <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/c1664769dae02044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Datapage link</em></a>.</p>

							<h1>Chapter 3 Definitions</h1>
					    <p>Now that we have looked at the graphical representation of data, lets talk about calculating descriptive statistics for our data.
								Once again we are wanting to focus on the idea of the center and spread of our data. There are 4 key staticits that help determine these ideas:</p>
					    <ul>
					       <li>The mean,</li>
					       <li>The median,</li>
					       <li>percentiles, and</li>
					       <li>the standard deviation</li>
					    </ul>
					    <p>The mean and median are measures of center, while percentiles and standard deviation help tell us about the spread of our data.</p>
							<p class="fragment">
								Before we go through these, it's worth pointing out that the mean and standard deviation are the most important to understand thoroughly. <br />
								It's worth understanding percentiles from a conceptual standpoint, but we will rarely compute them directly. We will compute mean and standard deviation.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3>The mean</h3>
							<p>The <em>mean</em> is a measure of where the data is centered.  It is computed by simply  averaging the numbers.</p>
							<p>
								For example, our data might be:
									$$2,8,2,4,7.$$
								The mean of the data is then:
								$$\frac{2+8+2+4+7}{5} = \frac{23}{5} = 4.6.$$
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 id="The-median">The median</h3>
							<p>Like the mean, the <em>median</em> is a measure of where  the data is centered.</p>
							<p>Roughly speaking, it represents the middle value. They way  it is computed depends on  how many numbers are in your list.</p>
							<div class="fragment">
		            <p>If the number of terms in  your data is odd, then the median is simply the middle entry.</p>
		            <p>For example, if the data is
		               $$1,3,4,8,9,$$
		               then the median is $4$.
		            </p>
							</div>
							<div class="fragment">
								<p>If the number of terms in  your data is even, then the median is simply the average of the middle two entries.</p>
								<p>For example, if the data is
								   $$1,3,8,9,$$
								   then the median is $(3+8)/2 = 5.5$.
								</p>

						               <li>The inter-quartile range is the difference between the third and first quartile.</li>

						          To find percentiles, it helps to sort the data:

						        <ul>

						          <li>The standard deviation forms a measure of the spread of a population or sample related to the <em>mean</em> of the population or sample.</li>
