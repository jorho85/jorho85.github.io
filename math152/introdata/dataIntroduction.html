				    Last time, we learned some data basics with a focus on data tables, which neatly organize data into rows of observations and columns of variables.

                            There are two main techniques to systematically collect data:
                        </p>

						<p>
                            An <em>observational study</em> is one where the data collection does not interfere with how the data arises. Examples include
                        </p>
						<ul>
						   <li>Surveys,</li>
						   <li>Review of records,</li>

						<p>
							In an <em>experiment</em>, researchers actively work with the samples applying treatments and observing effects.

							<li>
								Often (if not always), the intention is to explore a relationship or even a causal effect between two variable.

							To perform an observational study, we might select 14 CCCTI students and interview them. We might ask a number of questions but two questions key to the study would be:

                    <p>
                        Suppose we find that, of the 14 students in our sample, the students drink 2.57 cups of coffee a day on average.
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                            That average number 2.57 computed from the sample is a <em>statistic</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we could somehow determine the average number of cups of coffee consumed by <em>all</em> 3876 CCCTI students, that number would be a <em>parameter</em>.

                        Typically, it's not necessarily feasible to compute a parameter from an entire population. Thus, we <em>estimate</em> population parameters from sample statistics. A key question is:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        How close can we expect a computed statistic to be to the corresponding population parameter?

                    <p>
                        A <em>confounding variable</em> is a variable (often unknown) that influences two or more other variables and causes a spurious association.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the coffee GPA example, a confounding variable might be the amount of time the student studies. If they study a lot, the might find themselves drinking more coffee <em>and</em> increase their GPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term <em>lurking variable</em> is a synonym for confounding variable.

                        In statistics, we are often interested in the effect of one variable on another. In the context of the coffee study - does the consumption of caffeinated coffee improve GPA?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the potential presence of unknown confounding variables, whether there is a relationship between two variables - and <em>not</em> whether there is a causal relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is sometimes phrased as

                        To explore this question via a controlled experiment, we would start with a large, simple random sample of participating college students. We would <em>randomly</em>

                        <li>The treatment group, who would be required get 8 or more hours of sleep each night and</li>
                        <li>the control group, who would get less than 8 or at least they are not required to get 8 hours.</li>

                        This looks like it might be compelling evidence that 8 hours of sleep boosts GPA. We would ultimately like to be able to quantify that statement.

                                <li>A treatment group that receives the treatment</li>

                        Before we go through these, it's worth pointing out that the mean and standard deviation are the most important to understand thoroughly. <br />
                        It's worth understanding percentiles from a conceptual standpoint, but we will rarely compute them directly. We will compute mean and standard deviation.

                        The <em>mean</em> is a measure of where the data is centered.  It is computed by simply  averaging the numbers.

                        $$2,8,2,4,7.$$
                        The mean of the data is then:

                        Like the mean, the <em>median</em> is a measure of where  the data is centered.

                                        The median is a special case of a percentile - 50% of the population lies below the median and 50% lies above.

                                    To find percentiles, it helps to sort the data:

                                    There are differing conventions on how you interpolate when the number of terms doesn't work well with the percentile, but these differences diminish with sample size.

                                        You might see the definition
                                        $$s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2-\bar{x})^2 +\cdots+(x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n}.$$
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The difference in the definition is the $n$ in the denominator, rather than $n-1$.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The difference arises because
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                The definition with the $n$ in the denominator is applied to <em>populations</em> and
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The definition with the $n-1$ in the denominator is applied to <em>samples</em>.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li>
                                        To make things clear, we will sometimes refer to <em>sample variance</em> vs <em>population variance</em>.
                                    </li>
						        </ul>

                                    More often than not, we will be computing <em>sample</em> variance and the corresponding standard deviation.
