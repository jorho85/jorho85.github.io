  <h2>Introduction to Hypothesis Testing</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our next topic: Hypothesis Testing. Building on our understanding of confidence intervals, we'll explore how to make inferences about a population based on sample data.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Connecting Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing</h3>
  <p>In our last lesson, we learned how confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter. Now, we will use similar concepts to test specific claims or hypotheses about a population parameter.</p>
  <p>Think of hypothesis testing as a way to make decisions or judgments about the value of a population parameter, using sample data.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>What is a Hypothesis?</h3>
  <p>A hypothesis is a statement about a population parameter that we want to test. It always comes in two forms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</strong> This is the default assumption or status quo. It's a statement of no effect or no difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>):</strong> This is what you want to prove. It's a statement that there is an effect or a difference.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Types of Hypothesis Tests</h3>
  <p>There are several types of hypothesis tests, depending on the nature of the data and the hypotheses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One-Sample Z-test:</strong> Used when the population variance is known or can be calculated and the sample size is large.</li>
    <li><strong>One-Sample t-test:</strong> Used when the population variance is unknown and/or the sample size is small.</li>
    <li><strong>Two-Sample t-test:</strong> Used to compare the means of two independent groups.</li>
    <li><strong>Chi-Square Test:</strong> Used for categorical data to test the relationship between two variables.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Key Terms in Hypothesis Testing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Significance Level (Î±):</strong> The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Commonly set at 0.05.</li>
    <li><strong>p-value:</strong> The probability of obtaining the observed sample results, or more extreme results, when the null hypothesis is true.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> A standardized value calculated from sample data, used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Critical Value:</strong> A threshold value that the test statistic must exceed to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
  </ul>
</section>>

						<h1>The basics</h1>
						<p> What kinds of questions can Hypothesis test help us with in this course: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Does my bank have higher complains of identiy theft?</li>
							<li>Do polyphenols reduce inflimation markers in macropages?</li>
							<li>Does this new study method help students do better on exams?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Using the mathematical ideas of probability distributions we derived in chapters 5 and 6 we want to: </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Define a null and alrenative hypothesis based on our question of interest.</li>
							<li>Find the test statistic to use to assess the probability that the null hypothesis happens.</li>
							<li>Use that information to determine if we have evidence to support our claim.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Using the "Claim" to make your hypotheses</h2>
						<p>Suppose that you read on the back of a battery pack that this specific brand has an average life of 500 days with a standard devation of 25 days. But having used these
						batteries for years, you have a feeling the average is a bit less than 500. So, you spend the next few years collecting data on 300 of these batteries and find the average to be
						490 days... so what now?</p>
						<p>We have two hypotheses we can make here, which we want to think of as guesses i.e. the claim on the back of the box and our claim. In statistics we have names for these claims:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> <b>null hypotheses</b> $H_0$: historical value, claim, or product specification. (Always has equality)</li>
							<li> <b>alternative hypotheses</b> $H_A$: typically what you want to prove. ($<$, $>$ , or $\neq$)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Example</h1>
						<p>For the battery example we would say:</p>
						<p>$H_0: \mu = 500$ days, since the manufacturer claims the mean life of a battery is 500 days</p>
						<p>$H_A: \mu < 500$ days, since the you claim like the mean life of a battery is less than 500 days</p>
						<p>Ok, now that we have our claims how do we "test them"?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Finding the p-value</h1>
						<p>The book (p.232) defines the p-value to be the "probability that the test statistic will take on more extreme values than the observed test statistic,
							given that the null hypothesis is true."</p>
						<p> In other words, we are looking to see the chances that we got our sample with its specific statics from a population that has the given parameters. In our battery example
						we want to test to find the probability that a sample of size 300 would be to have a average life of 490 days, given that the populations average is 500 days. To do this we
					we can use the ideas from the central limit therom and z-scores.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Historical aside - (the first p-value)</h1>
						<p>While at the time there was no formal math called statistics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arbuthnot" target="_blank">John Arbuthnot</a>
						is credited with calculating the first p-value as we define it today. His question was:</p>
						<p> <b>Are males and females born at equal ratios?</b> </p>
						<p>After looking at over 80 years of birth records he found that in almost every year more males were born. Under the equla ratio assumption we would expect to see
						more females half the time. So it should be very unlikely that there would be more males born every year.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Calculating and quantifying the unlikely</h1>
						<p>Let's look at how unlikely this even really was by looking at what Arbuthnot argued: The probability that more males are
						born in any particualr year is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability of getting more males 82 years in a row would be... </p>
						<div>
							$$(\frac{1}{2})^{82} \approx 2.06795 \times 10^{-25}$$
						</div>
						<p>This is a very small probability, so it seem to support the idea that our assumption about equal ratios was incorrect.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Let's modernize this example</h1>
						<p>In this example we can set up our two hypotheses as:</p>
						<p>$H_0: p = 0.5$ because we expect there to be equal numbers of males and females</p>
						<p>$H_A: p \neq 0.5$ because this would mean that one of the genders is more likely</p>
						<p>Notice that in this case our claim would be the null, because this is the one we expect to see.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Critical values</h1>
						<p>We will need to use the z-score to get a normalized value for our test and so we can plug this z-score into
							the <a href="https://onlinestatbook.com/2/calculators/normal_dist.html" target="_blank">standard normal calculator</a>. The formula for a z-score
						calculated for a proportion is:</p>
						$$z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}}$$
						<p>Where</p>
						<ul>
							<li>$\hat{p}$ is the observed probability of success from the sample</li>
							<li>$p$ is the stated probability of success</li>
							<li>$q = 1 - p$</li>
							<li>$n$ is the sample size</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Back to our example</h1>
						<p>Let's assume that he saw $80$ of the $82$ years have more males than females. Then $\hat{p} = \frac{80}{82} = 0.975097561$ and</p>
						$$\sqrt{(0.5 * 0.5)/82} \approx 0.0555215763074$$
						<p>Now we can use these values in calculating our critical z value:</p>
						$$\frac{0.975097561 - 0.5}{0.0555215763074} \approx 8.613659352$$
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Gettng our p-value</h1>
						<p>Now that we have our critical z value we can use our <a href="https://onlinestatbook.com/2/calculators/normal_dist.html" target="_blank">standard normal calculator</a>
						to find the p-value.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://jorho85.github.io/proportionTest.PNG" alt="proportionTest.PNG" style="height: 25vw; max-height: 350px">
						</div>
						<p>Notice how this is a two tailed test because we used not equals. Also, notice that our p-value is very small. Here is a helpful phrase to remember what this means "if the p is low then
							the null must go", so we reject the null hypothesis claim that the ratios are equal.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>What about means?</h1>
						<p>You might be looking back at the first example and wondering how all this works with means like we were given in the batter example. Well we need a slightly different
							formula for our critical z value:</p>
							$$z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}}$$
						<p>Where</p>
						<ul>
							<li>$\bar{x}$ is the mean of your sample</li>
							<li>$\mu$ is the populations mean</li>
							<li>$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population</li>
							<li>$n$ is the size of the sample</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Back to the batteries</h1>
						<p>Let's look our our battery example where you should recall: $\bar{x} = 490$, $\mu = 500$, $\sigma = 25$ and $n = 300$. So</p>
						$$z = \frac{490 - 500}{25/ \sqrt{300}} = -6.928$$
						<p>Then we can use that value in our standard normal calculator just like we did in the last problem. In fact the only different in these test will typically be the calculation of the
							test statistic.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Using a t-critical Value</h1>
						<p>Now let's assume we do not know the population standard deviation. Instead, we use the sample standard deviation \(s = 30\) days.</p>
						<p>We need to use the t-distribution because we are estimating the population standard deviation from our sample. The formula for the t-statistic is:</p>
						$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$
						<p>Where</p>
						<ul>
							<li>\(\bar{x} = 490\)</li>
							<li>\(\mu = 500\)</li>
							<li>\(s = 30\)</li>
							<li>\(n = 300\)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>		
					<section>
						<p>So, we calculate:</p>
						$$t = \frac{490 - 500}{30 / \sqrt{300}} = \frac{-10}{1.732} \approx -5.77$$
						<p>We then compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table with \(df = n - 1 = 299\) degrees of freedom at the desired level of significance (e.g., \(\alpha = 0.05\)).</p>
						<p>If our calculated t-statistic is beyond the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Finding the t-critical Value</h1>
						<p>Using a t-table or an online calculator, we find the critical value for a one-tailed test at \(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(df = 299\) to be approximately \(t_{0.05, 299} \approx -1.645\).</p>
						<p>Since \(-5.77 < -1.645\), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the average battery life is indeed less than 500 days.</p>
