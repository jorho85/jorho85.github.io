                                            If we observe a large number of independent repetitions of a random event, then the proportion $\hat{p}$ of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the <em>probability</em> $p$ of that outcome.

                                    <p>
                                        The Law of Large Numbers can be written symbolically as
                                    </p>
                                    $$P(A) \approx \frac{\# \text{ of occurrences of } A}{\# \text{ of trials}}.$$
                                    <p>
                                        More importantly, the error in the approximation approaches zero as the number of trials approaches $\infty$.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Again, this is a <em>symbolic</em> representation where:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The symbol $A$ represents a set of possible outcome contained in the sample space. Such a set is often called an <em>event</em>.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The symbol $P$ represents a function that computes probability. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Thus, $P(A)$ tells us the probability that the event $A$ occurs.

                                        It's important to understand that observations made in the Law of Large numbers are <em>independent</em> - the separate occurrences have nothing to do with one another and prior events cannot influence future events.

                                        We now turn to the question of how to compute the probabily of certain types of events, which is not so bad, once you understand a few formulae and basic principles.

                                        The serious, mathematical study of probability theory has its origins in the $17^{\text{th}}$ century in the writings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> who studied - gambling. Many elmentary examples in probability theory are still commonly phrased in terms of gambling. As a result, it's long standing tradition to use coin flips, dice rolls and playing cards to illustrate the basic principles of probability. Thus, it does help to have a basic familiarity with these things.

If we know the probability that $A$ occurs and we know the probability that $B$ occurs, then we can compute the probability that $A$ or $B$ occurs by simply adding the probabilities. Symbolically,

                                        Now, things are getting a little tougher so let's include the computation for that second one right here. Let's define our symbols and say
                                    </p>
\begin{align*}
A &amp;= \text{we draw an odd numbered card}\\
B &amp;= \text{we draw a club}.
\end{align*}
                                    <p>
                                        In a standard deck, there are four odd numbers we can draw: 3, 5, 7, and 9; and four of each of those for a total of 16 odd numbered cards. Thus, $$P(A) = \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}.$$ There are also 13 clubs so that $$P(B) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}.$$
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, there are four odd numbered cards that are clubs - the 3 of clubs, the 5 of
                                        clubs, the 7 of clubs, and the 9 of clubs. Thus, the probability of drawing an
                                        odd numbered card that is also a club is
                                        $$P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.$$
                                        Putting this all together, we get
                                        $$P(A \text{ or } B) = \frac{4}{13} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{13} = \frac{25}{52}.$$

The probability that the second card is a heart is different because we now have a deck with 51 cards and 12 hearts. Thus, the probability of getting a second heart is $12/51 = 4/17$. Thus, the answer to the question is $$\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{4}{17} = \frac{1}{17}.$$ To write this symbolically, we might let

                                        Sometimes, it is the computation of conditional probability itself that we are interested in. Thus, we might rewrite our general multiplication rule in the form $$P(B\,|\,A)  = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}.$$

                                        In statistics, we'd often like to compute probabilities from data. For example, here's a contingency table based on our CDC data relating smoking and exercise:
