    <h1>Higher-Order Polynomials in Computer Graphics</h1>

    		<p>In computer graphics, higher-order polynomials play a crucial role in creating visually stunning and realistic scenes. One fascinating example is the use of <strong>Bézier curves</strong>.</p>

    		<p class="fragment">Bézier curves are parametric curves defined by higher-order polynomials, typically cubic (degree 3) or quadratic (degree 2).</p>

    		<p class="fragment">Here's why Bézier curves are fascinating:</p>

    			<ul>
        		<li class="fragment">1. <strong>Smooth Curves:</strong> Cubic Bézier curves are perfect for creating smooth, elegant curves that connect two endpoints while allowing control over the curve's shape.</li>
        		<li class="fragment">2. <strong>Bezier Splines:</strong> Multiple Bézier curves can be connected to form splines, enabling the creation of complex shapes, such as fonts, car bodies, and animations.</li>
        		<li class="fragment">3. <strong>Animation:</strong> Bézier curves are used in animation software to define motion paths, allowing objects to move smoothly and realistically.</li>
        		<li class="fragment">4. <strong>3D Modeling:</strong> In 3D modeling, Bézier surfaces (an extension of curves) are used to define complex shapes and surfaces with precision.</li>
        		<li class="fragment">5. <strong>Graphic Design:</strong> Graphic designers use Bézier curves in software like Adobe Illustrator to create vector graphics with precise curves and shapes.</li>
        		<li class="fragment">6. <strong>Game Development:</strong> Game engines utilize Bézier curves to design character movements, camera paths, and terrain generation.</li>
    			</ul>

    <h1>Polynomials: General Definition and Characteristics</h1>

    <p>A polynomial is a mathematical expression of the form:</p>

    <p class="fragment">\(P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\)</p>

    <p class="fragment">where:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment"><strong>\(P(x)\)</strong> is the polynomial function.</li>
        <li class="fragment"><strong>\(x\)</strong> is the variable or independent variable.</li>
        <li class="fragment"><strong>\(a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_2, a_1, a_0\)</strong> are coefficients, where \(a_n \neq 0\) and \(n\) is a non-negative integer.</li>
        <li class="fragment">The highest power of \(x\) (the highest \(n\)) is the <strong>degree</strong> of the polynomial.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fragment">Now, let's explore some characteristics of polynomials:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">- The <strong>domain</strong> of a polynomial is all real numbers (\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)) because it covers all possible values of the independent variable \(x\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">- The <strong>range</strong> depends on the specific polynomial function and its degree. It may be limited or extend to \((-\infty, +\infty)\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">- The polynomial may have a <strong>maximum</strong> or <strong>minimum</strong> value, depending on its degree and leading coefficient. Higher-degree polynomials can have multiple extrema.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- The <strong>intercepts</strong> of a polynomial are the points where it intersects the x-axis (\(y = 0\)). These are the <strong>x-intercepts</strong> or <strong>zeros</strong>. The <strong>y-intercept</strong> is the point where it intersects the y-axis (\(x = 0\)).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Determining End Behavior of a Polynomial</h1>

    <p>The end behavior of a polynomial describes how the polynomial behaves as the independent variable (\(x\)) approaches positive or negative infinity. To determine the end behavior, follow these steps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">1. <strong>Examine the Degree (\(n\)):</strong> Determine the degree of the polynomial, which is the highest power of \(x\) in the polynomial's leading term.</li>
        <li class="fragment">2. <strong>Identify the Leading Coefficient (\(a_n\)):</strong> Find the coefficient of the term with the highest power of \(x\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">3. <strong>Consider Two Cases:</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="fragment">
        <p>a. <strong>Even Degree (\(n\) is even):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">- If the leading coefficient (\(a_n\)) is positive, both ends of the graph will rise as \(x\) goes to both positive and negative infinity.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- If \(a_n\) is negative, both ends of the graph will fall as \(x\) goes to both positive and negative infinity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment">
        <p>b. <strong>Odd Degree (\(n\) is odd):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">- If the leading coefficient (\(a_n\)) is positive, one end of the graph will rise as \(x\) goes to positive infinity, and the other end will fall as \(x\) goes to negative infinity.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- If \(a_n\) is negative, one end of the graph will fall as \(x\) goes to positive infinity, and the other end will rise as \(x\) goes to negative infinity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="fragment">Keep in mind that "rise" means the graph approaches positive infinity, and "fall" means the graph approaches negative infinity.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Odd and Even Degrees of Polynomials and Their Symmetry</h1>

    <p>The degree of a polynomial has a direct connection to its symmetry, or lack thereof. Let's explore how odd and even degrees of polynomials relate to symmetry:</p>

    <div class="fragment">
        <p>1. <strong>Odd-Degree Polynomials (n is odd):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">- These polynomials often <strong>orgin symmetry</strong>.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- As \(x\) approaches both positive and negative infinity, one end of the graph rises while the other falls, creating a <strong>skew or slant symmetry</strong>.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- The graph may have a <strong>one or many x-intercept</strong>.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- Example: \(f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 3\)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment">
        <p>2. <strong>Even-Degree Polynomials (n is even):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">- These polynomials often exhibit <strong>y-axis symmetry</strong>.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- As \(x\) approaches both positive and negative infinity, both ends of the graph rise or fall together, creating a <strong>mirror symmetry</strong> about the y-axis.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- The graph may have <strong>none or multiple x-intercepts</strong> and can resemble a parabola or more complex shapes.</li>
            <li class="fragment">- Example: \(f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 4\)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="fragment">Understanding the degree of a polynomial can provide insights into its symmetry characteristics, aiding in graph analysis and interpretation.</p>

						<h1>Small note on complex numbers</h1>
						<p>Complex number are the large set of numbers that the real number exist as a part of, and they are made of a real part and an imaginary part.</p>
						<p class="fragment">If we let $\sqrt{-1} = i$ then we open up solutions to $x^2 + 1 = 0$ that just cant exist in the real number system.</p>
						<p class="fragment">While not a direct object of study for this course, it is important that pre-calculus students are aware of these numbers.</p>
						<p class="fragment">For those who are interested here is a medium article on how to find the three answers to $x^3 - 1 = 0$ <a href="https://medium.com/math-simplified/how-many-cubes-roots-of-1-are-there-22d6b564a3f" target="_blank">Link to article</a>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The most important take away from this is that polynomials when set equal to zero can give answers that go beyond the real numbers,
							but we only have real number in our codomain to make ranges out of and therefor we will not get them as solutions. They are still important because...</p>

    		<h1>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</h1>

    		<p>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is a fundamental result in complex analysis and algebra that has profound implications for polynomial equations. It states:</p>

    		<p class="fragment">"Every non-constant polynomial equation with complex coefficients has at least one complex root."</p>

    		<p class="fragment">Key points to understand:</p>

    		<ul>
        	<li class="fragment">- "Non-constant polynomial equation" refers to equations with terms of the form \(ax^n\), where \(a\) is a complex coefficient and \(n\) is a positive integer.</li>
        	<li class="fragment">- "Complex coefficients" means that both the coefficients of the polynomial and the roots can be complex numbers.</li>
        	<li class="fragment">- "Complex root" indicates that even if the polynomial equation doesn't have real solutions, it will always have complex solutions in the form \(x = a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers and \(i\) is the imaginary unit (\(i^2 = -1\)).</li>
    		</ul>

    		<p class="fragment">The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is a powerful result that ensures that every polynomial equation can be completely factored into linear and irreducible quadratic terms with complex roots.</p>

    <h1>Example: Polynomial with Zeros and Always Decreasing</h1>

    <p>Let's construct a polynomial equation that has zeros at \(x = 1\), \(x = 2\), and \(x = -3\) and is always decreasing.</p>

    <p class="fragment">1. Start with the factored form of the polynomial using its zeros:</p>

    <p class="fragment">\[P(x) = a(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\]</p>

    <p class="fragment">2. To ensure that the polynomial is always decreasing, let's assume \(a = -1\):</p>

    <p class="fragment">\[P(x) = -(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\]</p>

    <p class="fragment">3. Now, we have a polynomial equation that meets your criteria:</p>

    <p class="fragment">\[P(x) = -(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\]</p>

    <p class="fragment">This polynomial equation has zeros at \(x = 1\), \(x = 2\), and \(x = -3\),
			and it's always decreasing because its leading coefficient is negative (-1).</p>
			<p class="fragment">Note that we could have found a value for $a$ if we had another point. But, it super important to remember that
				this numbers sign determines the end behaviour.</p>

			    <h1>Average Rate of Change of a Polynomial</h1>

			    <p>The average rate of change of a polynomial function over an interval measures how the function's values change on average between two points. It can provide insights into the function's behavior over that interval.</p>

			    <p class="fragment">To calculate the average rate of change between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\) for a polynomial function \(P(x)\), use the following formula:</p>

			    <p class="fragment">\[ \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{P(b) - P(a)}{b - a} \]</p>

			    <p class="fragment">Key points to understand:</p>

			    <ul>
			        <li class="fragment">- The numerator \(P(b) - P(a)\) represents the change in the function's values between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\).</li>
			        <li class="fragment">- The denominator \(b - a\) is the length of the interval over which you are calculating the average rate of change.</li>
			        <li class="fragment">- The result is a measure of the average slope or rate of change of the function over that interval.</li>
			    </ul>

			    <p class="fragment">The average rate of change can help analyze trends and behavior of the polynomial function, such as whether it's increasing, decreasing, or constant over the interval.
						For linear polynomial's the rate of change is the slope coefficient.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to Polynomial Division</h1>

    <p>Polynomial division is a fundamental concept in algebra that allows us to divide one polynomial by another. It plays a crucial role in simplifying, factoring, and solving polynomial equations.</p>

    <p class="fragment">Key points to understand:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">- Polynomial division involves dividing a polynomial, known as the <strong>dividend</strong>, by another polynomial, known as the <strong>divisor</strong>.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- The goal is to find a <strong>quotient</strong> polynomial and a <strong>remainder</strong> polynomial, if any.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- Polynomial division is analogous to long division with numbers, but we use algebraic techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fragment">We use polynomial division to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">- Simplify complex expressions by factoring.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- Find roots or zeros of polynomials.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- Perform partial fraction decomposition.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- Divide polynomials to solve equations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fragment">In this course, we will explore the process of polynomial division and its applications.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Example: Dividing polynomial example</h1>

    <p>Let's walk through the process of dividing the polynomial \(x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6\) by \(x + 3\).</p>

    <p class="fragment">Step 1: Set up the long division:</p>

    <pre class="fragment">

    ___________________
x + 3 | x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6
    </pre>

    <p class="fragment">Step 2: Divide the first term of the dividend (\(x^3\)) by the first term of the divisor (\(x\)). This gives \(x^2\).</p>

    <p class="fragment">Step 3: Multiply the divisor (\(x + 3\)) by the result from Step 2 (\(x^2\)), and write it below the dividend. Subtract this result from the dividend.</p>

    <pre class="fragment">
          x^2
    ___________________
x + 3 | x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6
          -(x^3 + 3x^2)
          ---------------
                 x^2 + x
    </pre>

    <p class="fragment">Step 4: Repeat the process. Divide the first term of the new dividend (\(x^2\)) by the first term of the divisor (\(x\)). This gives \(x\).</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>cont.</h2>
    <p class="fragment">Step 5: Multiply the divisor (\(x + 3\)) by the result from Step 4 (\(x\)), and write it below the remaining part of the dividend. Subtract this result from the previous remainder.</p>

    <pre class="fragment">
          x^2 + x
    ___________________
x + 3 | x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6
          -(x^3 - 3x^2)
          ---------------
                 x^2 + x
                 -(x^2 - 3x)
                ------------
                        4x - 6
    </pre>

    <p class="fragment">Step 6: Repeat the process again. Divide the first term of the new dividend (\(4x\)) by the first term of the divisor (\(x\)). This gives \(4\).</p>

    <p class="fragment">Step 7: Multiply the divisor (\(x + 3\)) by the result from Step 6 (\(4\)), and write it below the remaining part of the dividend. Subtract this result from the previous remainder.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>cont.</h2>
    <pre class="fragment">
          x^2 + x - 2

x + 3 | x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6

          ---------------
                 x^2 + x
                 -(x^2 - 3x)
                ------------
                        4x - 6
                        -(4x -6)
                    ------------
                              0
    </pre>

    <p class="fragment">Step 8: We have reached a constant term (0), which is <strong>less than the divisor's degree (\(x + 3\))</strong>. This is the remainder, and we can stop here.</p>

    <p class="fragment">The result of dividing \(x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6\) by \(x + 3\) is \(x^2 + x - 2\) with a remainder of 0.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>The remainder and its contection to the fundamental theorem of algebra</h1>
	<p>If the remainder is a 0, then our divisor is a factor of the other polynomial.
		This also means that setting the divisor equal to zero and solving will produce a zero of the other polynomial.</p>
	<p class="fragment">So we should try to divided by polynomials that we think are factors, this could help us break down larger polynomials into small
		parts that we can find key information about our function quickly.</p>
	<p class="fragment">If only there were a test to help us check...</p>

    <h1>The Rational Zero Test</h1>

    <p>The Rational Zero Test, also known as the Rational Root Theorem, is a powerful tool for finding possible rational solutions (zeros) of a polynomial equation. It helps narrow down the search for roots.</p>

    <p class="fragment">Key points to understand:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">- The Rational Zero Test applies to polynomial equations of the form \(P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\), where all coefficients \(a_i\) are integers.</li>
        <li class="fragment">- Possible rational roots are of the form \(x = \frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) is a factor of the constant term \(a_0\) and \(q\) is a factor of the leading coefficient \(a_n\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">- The Rational Zero Test provides a list of possible rational roots to test, reducing the search space for polynomial zeros.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fragment">The steps to apply the Rational Zero Test:</p>

    <ol>
        <li class="fragment">1. List all the factors of the constant term \(a_0\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">2. List all the factors of the leading coefficient \(a_n\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">3. Form all possible fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) is a factor of \(a_0\) and \(q\) is a factor of \(a_n\).</li>
        <li class="fragment">4. Test each possible root using synthetic division or long division to find actual roots.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="fragment">The Rational Zero Test is a valuable tool for efficiently finding rational roots of polynomial equations, simplifying the root-finding process.</p>
