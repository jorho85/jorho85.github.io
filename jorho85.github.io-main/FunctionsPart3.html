						<h1>Transformations and Absolute Value</h1>
						<p>In our preparation for calculus, we aspire to understand functions from a wide range of perspectives and to become familiar with a library of basic functions.
						 As we progress further, we will endeavor to understand a “parent” function as the most fundamental member of a family of functions,
						 as well as how other similar but more complicated functions are the result of transforming the parent function. </p>
					</section>

						<h2>Vertical Translation of a Function</h2>
						<p> <b>Def 1.9</b> Given a function $y = f(x)$ and a real number $a$ the transformed function
						$y = g(x) = f(x) + a$ is a vertical translation of the graph of $f$. That is, every point $(x, f(x))$
					 on the graph of $f$ gets shifted vertically ot the corresponding point $(x, f(x) + a)$ on the graph of $g$.</p>

						<h2>Horizontal Translation of a Function</h2>
						<p> <b>Def 1.10</b> Given a function $y = f(x)$ and a real number $b$ the transformed function
						$y = h(x) = f(x - b)$ is a vertical translation of the graph of $f$. That is, every point $(x, f(x))$
					 on the graph of $f$ gets shifted vertically ot the corresponding point $(x + b, f(x))$ on the graph of $h$.</p>

						<h2>Vertical stretches</h2>
						<p>So far, we have seen the possible effects of adding a constant value to function’s output.
							Next, we investigate the effects of multiplication the function’s output by a constant.</p>
						<p> <b>Def 1.11</b> Given a function $y = f(x)$ and real number $c > 0$, the transformed function
						 $y = v(x) = cf(x)$ is a vertical strech of the graph of $f$. Every point $(x, f(x))$ on the graph of $f$
						 gets streched vertically to the corresponding point $(x, cf(x))$ on the graph $v$.</p>
					<p>If $0 < c < 1$, the graph compresses toward the x-axis.</p>
					<p>If $c > 1$ then $v$ is a stretch of $f$ away from the x-axis.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Vertical reflections</h2>
						<p> <b>Def 1.12</b> Given a function $y = f(x)$ and real number $c < 0$, the transformed function
						 $y = v(x) = cf(x)$ is a reflection of the graph $f$ across the x-axis followed by a vertical stretch by a factor of $|c|$.</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Order matters</h2>
						<p>Let $f(x) = x$ and $m(x) = 2f(x + 1) + 5$, what happens 1st? Translation or strech? If we follow order of operations ideas, we would add one first
							because the + 1 is inside of a parantheses. Next, we would multiply by 2. </p>

						<h2>On Horizontal stretches and compressions</h2>
						<p>Just like Translations, Horizontal stretches and compressions deal with the y-axis and not the x. Because the definition match the vertical ones,
							I am not goint to have you wrtie them out. Instead we will look at this demo:</p>

						<h2>Parent Functions</h2>
						<p>In this class, we will be exploring functions—the shapes of their graphs, their unique characteristics, their algebraic formulas,
							and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet.
							When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with functions,
							it is similarly helpful to have a base set of building-block elements. We call these our “parent functions,”
							which form a set of basic named functions for which we know the graph, formula, and special properties.</p>
						<p>In unit 2, we will add several parent functions to our personal toolkits. If you would like to make a print out of all the pre-calculus
						funtions you can find them in our book online here: <a href="https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/1-1-functions-and-function-notation#Table_01_01_14" target="_blank">LINK</a>.</p>
						<p>The first parent function we will add to our toolkit is the Absolute value function.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Piecewise review</h2>
						<p>A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output.
							Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the function is the union of all these smaller domains. We notate this idea like this:</p>
						$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
          			\text{algebraic formula 1} & \text{domain of forumla 1} \\
          			\text{algebraic formula 2} & \text{domain of forumla 2} \\
          			\text{algebraic formula 3} & \text{domain of forumla 3} \\
       				\end{cases}$$
							<p>Piecewise functions can be split into as many pieces as necessary.
								Each piece behaves differently based on the input function for that interval. Pieces may be single points, lines, or curves. </p>
					</section>

						<h2>The Absolute Value funtion</h2>
						<p> <b>Def 1.12</b> The absolute value function can be defined as a piecewise funtion:</p>
						$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
						x & x \geq 0 \\
						-x & x < 0
						\end{cases}$$
						<p>The absolute value function is commonly thought of as providing the distance the number is from zero on a number line.
							Algebraically, for whatever the input value is, the output is the value without regard to sign.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="fragments">
						<h2>Example of writing an interval in absolute value form</h2>
						<p>Let's say we want to describe all values x within our including a distance of 4 from the number 5.</p>
						<img src="https://jorho85.github.io/absoexamp.PNG" alt="absoexamp.PNG" class="fragment">
						<p class="fragment">The distance from x to 5 can be represented using the absoluate value as $|x - 5|$</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is the same as saying $-4 \leq (x - 5)$ and $(x - 5) \leq 4$, or $1 \leq x$ and $x \leq 9$</p>
						<p class="fragment">So $|x-5| \leq 4$ is equivalent to $1 \leq x \leq 9$</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How to solve an absolute value problem</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Isolate the absoluate value expression. That is move everyting not inside the absolute value to the other side of the equation.</li>
							<li>Use $|A| = B$ to write $A = B$ and $A = -B$. If $B < 0$ you won't have a solution.</li>
							<li>Solve both equation for x</li>
							<li>If you had an inequatility, make sure you graph your answers and find the interval.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Notice that we don't solve for x while there is still an inequatility on our page. We have to break down our problem into its smaller parts.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="fragments">
						<h2>An example</h2>
						<p>For the function $f(x) = |4x + 1| - 7$ find when $f(x) = 4$</p>
						<p class="fragment">Let's substitute $4$ for $f(x)$ to get $4 = |4x + 1| - 7$</p>
						<p class="fragment">Now we isolate the absolute value by adding 7 to both sides to get $11 = |4x + 1|$</p>
						<p class="fragment">Now we eliminate the absolute value by writing two equations $11 = 4x + 1$ and $-11 = 4x + 1$</p>
						<p class="fragment">Now solve both for x to get $x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5$ and $x = -3$, which are both solutions.</p>

					<h2>Review and helpful videos</h2>
					<p> A transformation of a given function $f$ is a process by which the graph may be shifted or stretched to generate a new, related function with fundamentally the same shape. In this section we considered four different ways this can occur: through a horizontal translation (shift), through a reflection across the line
					$y=0$	(the x-axis), through a vertical scaling (stretch) that multiplies every output of a function by the same constant, and through a vertical translation (shift).
					Each of these individual processes is itself a transformation, and they may be combined in various ways to create more complicated transformations.</p>
